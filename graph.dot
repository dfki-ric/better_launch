    This example will create a Composer node and load two example plugins into it from the composition package:
    * composition/composition::Talker
    * composition/composition::Listener

    Using the terminal UI (the TUI), you will see how they appear as a single node. Opening the node dialog from the sidebar will also allow you to unload individual components or kill the entire composer.
