.. better_launch documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Thu Feb 13 17:08:43 2025.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. since we use numpy docstrings we need to run napoleon first so autodoc can understand them. 
   To build the documentation:

   sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source .
   cd docs
   make html
